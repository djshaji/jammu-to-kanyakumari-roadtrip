## What I need from you to refine it
1. Vehicle type and fuel (petrol/diesel; typical km/l).
2. Number of people and luggage/load (affects pace & hotel choices).
3. Preference: fastest/direct (NH44 both ways) or scenic (southwest coast return/Konkan).
4. Do you want me to suggest or hold hotels (I can propose hotels; I cannot book without your confirmation)?

Safe driving and let me know your preferences so I can produce a refined, distance‑timed Markdown itinerary or a shareable map.
